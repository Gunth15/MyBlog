# Obligatory Website Post

This is just a reminder for myself about why I built this website.
There will be more useful posts in the future, I promise.
This website is where I’ll practice communicating the technical concepts I’ve learned and will continue to learn.

## Elixir or Go

The hardest part of creating this website was choosing a tech stack. Elixir was really tempting, and I could have finished the project much sooner, but I ultimately chose Go for its low resource consumption, which helps offset costs if I decide to run it locally. For future web-based projects, I’ll probably go with Elixir for its convenience.

## How It Works

Version control was essential, so I used GitHub.
This allows me to write blog posts in NeoVim or any other text editor and then upload them to Git.
It also enables collaboration and backups, so viewers like you can suggest edits to my posts.
I keep a [public repository](https://github.com/Gunth15/MyBlog.git) where posts are pulled from and added to the private website repo. This sync happens daily to keep content up to date.
The setup uses a public GitHub repo containing both a live and a blog folder.

## I'm Not Done Yet

While working on this website, I discovered static site generation. This approach is far better since most of the content here could be rendered at compile time without changing afterward. It would also allow me to host the site much more cheaply.
Thanks for reading!
