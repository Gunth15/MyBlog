# Obligatory website post

This is just a reminder for me on why I build this website.
There will be more useful post in the future I promise.
This website is were I will practicing communicating the technical concepts I have learned and will learn.

## Elixir or Go

The hardest part of writing my website was deciding a tech stack. Elixir was really enticing and I would have been done a lot sooner, but I ultimately went with go because of it's low resource consumption to offset any cost if I wanted to run this locally. For future web-based projects, I will probably choose Elixir because of it's convenience however.

## How it works

Version control was a must, so I leveraged GitHub.
That way I can just write blog post in NeoVim or any other text editing tool and upload them to git.
Also enables collaborations and backup capability so viewers like you can make edits to my post.
I have a [public repository](https://github.com/Gunth15/MyBlog.git) where post are pulled from and added to the private website repo. This is done daily to keep content up to date.
Can use a public Github repo with a live and blog folder.

## I'm not done yet

Whilst writing this website I discovered static site generation. This is a way better idea considering most of the content on this website could be rendered at compile time and nothing would change. It would also allow me to host this website for way cheaper.
Thanks fr reading!.
